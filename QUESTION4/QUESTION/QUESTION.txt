QUESTION:List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility
of HTML
Answer:
1) Use semantic tags in HTML : Semantic tags like <header>,<nav>
,<main> and <footer>,<article> improves the accessibility by providing
the meaningful structure.Making it easier for users with disabilities
to navigate and understand the content.

2) Use color with care : Color plays an important role in web design
but it should not be the only means of conveying the information.Ensure
that color is not the sole indicator of meaning.

3) Provide alt text for images : Adding description of image using 
alt attribute ensures that user who cannot see the images can 
understand their content and purpose.Screen reader read aloud the
alt text making visual content accessible to the people with visual
disabilities.
